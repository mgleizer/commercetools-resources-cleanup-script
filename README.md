## üßæ Description

This script is designed to work with the **commercetools API** and is used to delete all existing order edits in a given project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

**Use this script at your own risk.**  
Modifying the `API_URL` variable to point to a different endpoint will result in the **deletion of all resources** associated with that endpoint.

This script will **delete all order edits**.

We strongly recommend the following precautions:

- Use an authentication token with **only the `manage_order_edits` scope**.
- Have a **developer** perform this operation.
- **Test the script in a non-production environment** before running it in a live project.
